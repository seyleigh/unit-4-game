# unit-4-game
 

The goal of the game is to reach the randomly generated number at the beginning of each round. 

Each crystal is randomly assigned a value (which is hidden from you). You click the crystals and your score will add up according to the crystals clicked.

If you go above the computers random number you will lose. If you reach the number you win the game and it resets with new numbers, your score will reflect the outcome.

Refreshing the page will wipe out everything and make you start over.
