# unit-4-game

The goal of the game is to reach the randomly generated number at the beginning of each round. Each crystal is randomly assigned a value - which is not shown to you. You click the crystals and your score adds up according to the crystals clicked. If you go above the computers random number you lose. If you reach the number you win and the game resets with new numbers and your scores refect the outcome. Refreshing the page will wipe out everything and make you start over.
